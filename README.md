Creating a basic multifunctional calculator by implementing key concepts of PHP for server side programming.

The user is allowed to enter two numbers and select a mathematical operator from a dropdown menu to perform calculations.
In the implementation, I have used two approaches to build the calculator.
The og_phpcombo.php file contains a html form with the server side scripts embedded in it. 
The files separate_htmlform.php, separatestylesheet.css, separate_php.php have the form, style and scripts separated into different files for easy individual functionality and to enable CSS activation on the scripted codes.
